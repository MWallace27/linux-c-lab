# Linux, Shell, and C Lab

## Overview
This repository contains my work for the Ubuntu Linux, shell scripting, and C programming lab.

## Structure
- `command-line/`: Logs from command-line tasks.
- `shell-scripts/`: Shell scripts for automation.
- `c-programs/`: C programs with compilation.

## Testing and Running
- **Command Line:** Used `ls`, `cd`, `chmod`, etc., in Codespaces.
- **Shell Scripts:** Tested `easy-greet.sh` with input and `file-check.sh` for file existence checks.
- **C Programs:** Compiled with `gcc`. Ran `add.c`, `factorial.c`, and `contacts.c`.
- **Project:** `project.sh` compiles and runs `contacts.c`, creates a backup archive, and logs output.

## Challenges and Learnings
- Learned Git commits and compiling/debugging C with `gcc -g`.
- Challenges included file permissions and C pointer/struct syntax.
